sixty years ago this week on  october  allen ginsberg read howl aloud for the first time at the six gallery in san francisco its a poem with many anniversaries  ginsberg began writing it in mid and it wasnt published until   which may be why hal willner organised a thanniversary celebration of it at the ace hotel in los angeles in april of this year with a lineup including courtney love beth orton devendra banhart nick cave macy gray and peaches

that lineup hints at just how howl has permeated popular culture and unlike almost any other piece of literature helped shape music as it is today

ginsberg interdisciplinary before many other artists made many personal forays into music from collaborating with paul mccartney philip glass and the clash to his  experimental buddhist punk anthem birdbrain if you look in the background of the famous film for bob dylans subterranean homesick blues you can spot him standing to the singers right

howl though was where it began a hallucinatory tourdeforce that started the arms race between poetry and rocknroll it terrorised civilised society in the s  in  a clerk at the city lights bookstore in san francisco was jailed for selling it while city lights publisher lawrence ferlinghetti was prosecuted  and acquitted  for publishing it

howl is about drugs promiscuity youth alienation capitalism industrialisation expression conformity sexuality and the beauty of being in the gutter it glows with an idiosyncratic interest in selfexpression and the belief that the writer should refuse inhibition and selfcensorship it dismantled cultural mores and boundaries on a macrocosmic level but also inspired a new wave of musicians through style metre and imagery


ellen willis in her  essay before the flood wrote that dylans a hard rains agonna fall from his second album owed much to ginsbergs biblical rhetoric and declamatory style  but you could include much of his other work in the debt willis drew parallels between hippie culture  the bastard child of the beat generation born when the beats and the mids san francisco counterculture crossfertilised  and folk culture both movements rejected intellect for sensation politics for art and ginsberg and kerouac glorified a grassroots america that included supermarkets and cars as well as mountains and apple pie she wrote within howl there is a damning of authority yes but it lies with a celebration of human life that would provide nutrients for the next generations

cue patti smith on whose work ginsberg left an indelible mark music photographer kevin cummins who photographed ginsberg in manchester in  when the poet was feted by the punk establishment in england suggests smiths  debut piss factory wouldnt have existed without howl people didnt write poetry like that piss factory is a poem with a beat and nobody was doing that at the time he says cummins remembers how important the poem was for the artists he was mixing with such as joy division morrissey and david bowie it opened a world for us that we didnt know as much about

howl and judge clayton horn  the man who dismissed the case against ferlinghetti and ruled the poem was of redeeming social importance  set a new world in motion where musicians could express their sexuality without checking themselves for victorian notions of decency it was a rocket up the backside of conformity and censorship allowing talk of cock and balls and cunt and semen without shame or blush in new york the fugs took the lesson to heart and ginsberg returned the favour writing the liner notes for their second album in 


the musician peaches is more forthright howl started a revolution she says to be so brave and so open about the situation in america and homosexuality while using a style of writing which was almost a stream of consciousness that was confusing to people was completely powerful

but ginsberg needed to be encouraged howls delight in visceral human urges and saying the things that werent supposed to be said came after he was instructed by ferlinghetti to speak from the heart

he wasnt afraid of being human says david wrench producer for fka twigs jungle and caribou theres nothing to be ashamed of its all celebratory

wrench has observed the poems constant presence among younger bands bands often have books in the studio and howl is there all the time maybe with some blake or plath it keeps coming back because it inspires people

even if a musician hasnt heard howl theyre part of its ecosystem because its one of the building blocks of modern rocknroll you may not have been influenced by howl but youve been influenced by something it influences its a bit like smells like teen spirit says catherine anne davies who records and performs as the anchoress we forget how amazing it is and how at the time it would have been so shocking

the nuts and bolts of howl matter as well as the social impact like patti smith and dylan before her davies draws on ginsbergs verbal techniques im acutely attuned to metre and line and how howl is about spontaneous and improvised expression the composition seeps into my work she says

ginsberg played around with words using them to create the chassis of the poem the first section of which is built on the word who i depended on the word who to keep the beat a base to keep measure return to and take off from again onto another streak of invention he wrote in 

devendra banhart grew up in california in the s and remembers howl turning him on to poetry it was the first time i read a poem that made me sweat the first time that i read a poem that meant i couldnt speak i hit my head this is the power heres a living profound experience in words

it was the gateway for banharts interest in buddhism too and ginsberg was a gateway for generations of western musicians to explore eastern religions which swept into rock music a whole new realm of spirituality and mysticism

but  years after it was first performed is it still relevant it didnt sound in the least bit dated banhart says allen is writing about injustice and theres still injustice hes writing about liberation theres still the need for liberation hes writing about the thirst for peace freedom revolution all of those things are still a prominent concern of our times if anything theyve been magnified howl doesnt have an expiration date
