Python Lectures
----------------

What are we going to need?
==========================

We are going to need 2 pieces of software:

 * python
 * jupyter

## Python

[Python][1] is a very nice and useful programming language. It has found use in
many places.  The greatest thing about it that it has a very simple syntax 
which translates as it has [a very shallow learning curve][2], and that it has 
[tons of libraries][3].

## Jupyter

[Jupyter][5] is the software that will get you interact with the language. For these
lectures [Jupyter][5] is an IDE and computing environment which allows one to blend 
text (with a very simple markup language) and live python code/computation within the 
same document.  It is perfect for keeping lab journals, research diary, teaching or 
even writing blog posts that require a computational content.  [Jupyter][5] has 
support for a wide range of languages other than python.  

These lectures are jupyter/python notebooks.  Github has this nice feature that it 
renders these lectures without you running these lectures on your local machine.
