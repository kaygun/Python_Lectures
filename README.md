Python Lectures
----------------

What are we going to need?
==========================

We are going to need 2 pieces of software:

 * python
 * ipython or jupyter

## Python

[Python][1] is a very nice and useful programming language. I has found use in
many places.  The greatest thing about it that it has a very simple syntax 
which translates as it has [a very shallow learning curve][2], and that it has 
[tons of libraries][3].

## iPython or Jupyter

[IPython][4] and [Jupyter][5] are the software that will get you interact with 
the language. [IPython][4] is an IDE and computing environment which allows one 
to blend text (with a very simple markup language) and live python code/computation 
within the same document.  It is perfect for keeping lab journals, research diary, 
teaching or even writing blog posts that require a computational content. [iPython][4] 
later evolved to [Jupyter][5] which added support for other languges than 
python.  

The lectures are python notebooks.  Github has this nice feature that it renders
these lectures without you running these lectures on your local machine.
